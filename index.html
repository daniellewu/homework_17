                <h1>ABOUT</h1>
            <p>I’m a former human resources professional turned UX/UI student. Although HR gave me the satisfaction of helping others, I always felt a calling to do something more creative. Over the years, I volunteered to design announcements for events and company newsletters. The joy I experienced from creating something that was both useful and visually pleasing made me realize I needed to incorporate design and creativity into my work. Enter UX/UI design! This field would allow me to utilize my HR background to solve design problems in an empathetic, yet process-driven way.

    <h1>FEATURED PROJECT</h1>
    <h2>Recipeze</h2>
    <p>Recipeze is an app that’s designed to inspire and create a community for home chefs. Our app allows users to find easy recipes, share tips, photos, videos, and keep up to date with the latest food trends.</p>

    <div class="problemInfo">
        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>People try dishes while eating out and wonder how they can recreate it at home. However they rarely have the time, ingredients or the knowledge to figure it out. They often are looking for a community to help them solve their home cooking conundrums but can’t find one.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="userResearch">
    <h2>User Research</h2>
    <p>We wanted to understand how people are currently searching for recipes they want to recreate and what the pain points are in that process. Our researched included 5 in person interviews and a short 5 minute survey that yielded 40 responses.
        <br>
        <br>
        We sorted our responses with an affinity diagram and concluded that home chefs usually lack time and are hindered by complicated recipes that require shopping for lots of new ingredients. Due to this they don’t try new recipes as much they would like. A user persona was created to help guide our design.</p>

    <h2>Design</h2>
    <p>To improve home chefs’ motivation to try new recipes from an average of once a month to at least once a week we wanted to focus on the following things.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Make recipes more visually appealing with prominently placed high quality photos.</li>
        <li>Give users the ability to easily filter recipes by multiple factors.</li>
        <li>Incorporate a community platform that encourages knowledge sharing and feedback.</li>
